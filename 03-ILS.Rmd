# Integrated Library System

Aside from your regular librarian duties (which might involve instruction, reference, collection development, etc.), your primary focus as a community college Systems Librarian will involve managing the Integrated Library System (ILS). The ILS is what allows your library to process materials and make them publicly available for searching. As various systems have become more sophisticated and comprehensive, they are now sometimes referred to as a Library Services Platform (LSP). The LSP will allow your library added functionality with Acquistions, Discovery, and Analytics.  

Typically your ILS or LSP will be provided by a commercial vendor such as:
+ Ex Libris
+ Sirsi-Dynix
+ Sierra
